# Change Log

## May 27th, 2015
- Updated README.md, but it is a little too crazy. Consider moving some of README to documentation, and start documenting more.
- Added mySQLCommands, which can be passed to mySQL to generate the necessary tables.
- Updated mySQL Database to include all tables, as opposed to just Employees.
- Fixed login.php script, which will now successfully authenticate users and send them to the Copy Card Program page.
 - Session issuing has not yet been implemented. Next update, perhaps!
- mySQL Database tables now have functioning Foreign Keys.
